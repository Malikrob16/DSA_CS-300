# DSA_CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course the projects involved working with different data structures such as Linked list, Hash table, and Binary search tree. These structures are used to sort, display and manage class information from provided file.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I first focused on understanding how each structure would work with the managament and organization needed for the file. I decided that hash table was the most optimal structure to solve this problem. Data structures hold much significance because it serves as a over arching structure for informations that can be used no matter the person using it or the information size does not change how many will view the code.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Any roadblock I faced I overcame it by researching and understand why I am having the problem to give myself ideas on how to get past it. If that method did not help then I would make smaller scale codes to test out theries and solutions that could help.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Big-O analysis helped me think about performance and how to approach algorithmic design. It also helped me realize that I 
did not have to use recursively and that is a weakness in some of my potential designs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Practice is my biggest sticking point that I noticed helped improve many of my aspects coding. I find code that has to deal with files both reading and writing to be interesting and I have been practicing using that aspect in my personal projects.
